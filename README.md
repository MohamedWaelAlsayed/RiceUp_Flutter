• IOT With Firebase

This function is about using ESP32 Node MCU with Two sensors moisture and temperature, Start taking readings from the farm and saving them into RTDB (Real-time Data Base) provisioned with autoscaling and no latency, and sending them to Mobile Application in Real-Time to Monitor readings change over time (monitor factors that may increase diseases) and Show number of readings.
